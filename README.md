# Golang Concurrency

### Goroutines

Goroutines allow us to perform concurrent operations without the need for explicit thread management. Goroutines are created using the `go` keyword, followed by a function call.

### Channels

Channels are a way to communicate and synchronize data between goroutines. 

### Wait Groups

Wait Groups are a synchronization mechanism in Go that allow the main goroutine to wait for a group of goroutines to complete their execution before proceeding. They are particularly useful when you have multiple goroutines performing independent tasks and you want to wait for all of them to finish before continuing.
